# Artistic Filters with Hand Gesture Control

This project implements a real-time artistic filter application that uses hand gestures to control different filters. Built with OpenCV, it allows users to apply various artistic effects, such as sketch, cartoon, and emboss, based on hand gestures detected through the camera.

## Features
- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition**: Switch filters with gestures like thumbs up, peace sign, and closed fist.
- **Multiple Artistic Filters**: Choose from a variety of effects to apply to the video stream.
- **Intensity Control**: Adjust the filter intensity using a slider.
- **Real-time Preview**: Preview the effect in a separate window before applying it.
- **Save Processed Video**: Save the filtered video to your local drive.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
